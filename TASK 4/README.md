# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Machine Learning techniques. The system recommends movies similar to a user-selected movie by analyzing movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, director, and overview.

The recommendation engine uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Count Vectorization, and Cosine Similarity to identify and suggest similar movies.
